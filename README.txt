This is a port of the firmware from Shawn Wallace's bytebeat-exploring musical toy, Byteseeker Jr. ( https://moderndevice.com/news/build-a-hackable-bytebeat-player-at-the-ri-mini-maker-faire/ ) to a set of boards left over from Alex Norman' "Composition For Balloons And Electronics" in 2012.  ( http://www.x37v.info/blog/2012/10/24/composition_for_balloons_and_electronics/ )

Alex's boards use an attiny instead of an atmega, and have fewer inputs.
