Firmware for my "Bytebot" musical cardboard gift-toys.    http://mykle.com/msl/?p=690

This began as a port, and is now a complete rewrite, of the firmware from Shawn Wallace's bytebeat-exploring musical toy, Byteseeker Jr. ( https://moderndevice.com/news/build-a-hackable-bytebeat-player-at-the-ri-mini-maker-faire/ ) 

It runs on a set of boards gifted to me by Alex Norman, left over from his "Composition For Balloons And Electronics" in 2012.  ( http://www.x37v.info/blog/2012/10/24/composition_for_balloons_and_electronics/ )

Alex's boards use an attiny instead of the atmega in the Byteseeker Jr.  Instead of multiple pots for user input there is only a single button.
